<h2 id="the-problem-with-flat-priors">The problem with flat priors</h2>

<p>In his study of female birth rates in 18th century Paris, Laplace picked a <em>flat</em> or <em>uniform prior</em> on the birth rate \(\theta\in[0,1]\) because he had no (prior) reason to consider any value of \(\theta\) as more likely than other values of \(p\). This is the usual justification for flat priors. Unfortunately, this justification for flat priors is flawed.</p>

<p>Instead of the birth rate \(\theta\), consider the log-odds ratio of a female birth \(\eta \triangleq \log\frac{\theta}{1-\theta}\). There is no reason to consider any value of \(\eta\) as more likely than other values of \(\eta\), so one should pick a flat prior on \(\eta\). But this disagrees with the prior on \(\eta\) induced by the uniform prior on \(\theta\): \(\eta\) is a function of \(\theta\), so a prior on \(\theta\) induces a prior on \(\eta\). It is not hard to check that the prior on \(\eta\) induced by the flat prior on \(\eta\) is \(\pi(\eta) = \frac{e^\eta}{(1+e^\eta)^2}\), which is not flat.</p>

<p>The problem with flat priors is flatness is not preserved by reparameterization. If \(\pi\) is a prior on \(\theta\), then it induces the prior \(\pi(\varphi^{-1}(\eta))\vert\frac{d}{d\theta}\varphi^{-1}(\eta)\vert\) on \(\eta \triangleq \varphi(\theta)\), where \(\varphi\) is an invertible map, but this induced prior is generally not flat. This problem with flat priors was a major criticism of the Bayesian approach to data analysis in the early 20th century.</p>

<h2 id="jeffreys-invariance-principle">Jeffreys invariance principle</h2>

<p>In light of the problem with flat priors, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Jeffreys">Harold Jeffreys</a> proposed picking priors that are equivariant under reparameterization. Let \(f(y\mid\theta)\) be a model. Suppose we have a method of picking priors for different parameterizations of this model (we’ll see a concrete example later). We can use this method to pick a prior on \(\eta \triangleq \varphi(\theta)\) in two ways. First, we use the method directly to pick a prior on \(\eta\). Call this prior \(\pi_\eta\). Second, we use the method indirectly: use the method to pick a prior on \(\theta\) and use it to induce a prior on \(\eta\). This prior is</p>

\[\textstyle
\tilde{\pi}_\eta(\eta) = \pi_\theta(\varphi^{-1}(\eta))\vert\frac{d}{d\theta}\varphi^{-1}(\eta)\vert,\]

<p>where \(\pi_\theta\) is the prior on \(\theta\). Jeffrey’s invariance principle demands that the priors obtained directly and indirectly coincide (for any \(\varphi\)).</p>

<p>Jeffreys also proposed a concrete way of picking priors that satisfies his invariance principle. Let \(f(y\mid\theta)\) be a model. Its <strong>Fisher information</strong> at \(\theta\) is</p>

\[\textstyle I(\theta) \triangleq \int_{\cY}(\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\log f(y\mid\theta))^2f(y\mid\theta)dy.\]

<p>Jeffreys proposed picking a prior \(\pi_\theta(\theta) \propto I(\theta)^{\frac12}\). If \(\int_\Theta I(\theta)^{\frac12}d\theta &lt; \infty\), then the implied constant in Jeffreys prior is the reciprocal of the integral: this ensures the prior has total mass one. Otherwise, Jeffreys prior is an improper prior, and the constant is irrelevant.</p>

<p>It is not hard to check that this way of picking priors satisfies the invariance principle. Let \(\eta\triangleq\varphi(\theta)\) be a reparametrization of the model. The reparametrized model is \(g(y\mid\eta) \triangleq f(y\mid\varphi^{-1}(\eta))\), and Jeffreys prior on \(\eta\) is</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\pi_\eta(\eta)\;&amp;\textstyle= (\int_{\cY}(\frac{\partial}{\partial\eta}\log g(y\mid\eta))^2 g(y\mid\eta)dy)^{\frac12} \\
&amp;\textstyle= (\int_{\cY}(\frac{\partial}{\partial\eta}\log f(y\mid\varphi^{-1}(\eta)))^2 f(y\mid\varphi^{-1}(\eta))dy)^{\frac12} \\
&amp;\textstyle= (\int_{\cY}(\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\log f(y\mid\theta)\mid_{\varphi^{-1}(\eta)}\frac{d}{d\eta}\varphi^{-1}(\eta))^2 f(y\mid\varphi^{-1}(\eta))dy)^{\frac12} \\
&amp;\textstyle= (\int_{\cY}(\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\log f(y\mid\theta)\mid_{\varphi^{-1}(\eta)})^2 f(y\mid\varphi^{-1}(\eta))dy)^{\frac12}\vert\frac{d}{d\eta}\varphi^{-1}(\eta)\vert \\
&amp;\textstyle\propto \pi_\theta(\varphi^{-1}(\eta))\vert\frac{d}{d\eta}\varphi^{-1}(\eta)\vert,
\end{aligned}\]

<p>where we recognized</p>

\[\textstyle
I(\varphi^{-1}(\eta)) = \frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\log f(y\mid\theta)\mid_{\varphi^{-1}(\eta)})^2 f(y\mid\varphi^{-1}(\eta))dy\]

<p>in the fifth step. This is exactly the prior on \(\eta\) induced by Jeffreys prior on \(\theta\).</p>
