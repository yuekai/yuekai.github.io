<p>Despite the remarkable progress in the past decade, machine learning models can fail in</p>

<p>The progress of machine learning systems has seemed remarkable and inexorable — a wide array of benchmark tasks including image classification, speech recognition, and question answering have seen consistent and substantial accuracy gains year on year. However, these same models are known to fail consistently on atypical examples and domains not contained within the training data. This course will cover methods for understanding and improving machine learning under distributional shifts, where the training and test distribution for a model are mismatched.</p>

<p>My research uses tools from statistics to make machine learning systems more robust and reliable — especially in challenging tasks involving natural language. The goal of my research is to use robustness and worst-case performance as a lens to understand and make progress on several fundamental challenges in machine learning and natural language processing. A few topics of recent interest are,</p>

<p>Long-tail behavior
How can we ensure that a machine learning system won’t fail catastrophically in the wild under changing conditions?
Understanding
A system which understands how to answer questions or generate text should also do so robustly out-of-domain.
Fairness
Machine learning systems which rely on unreliable correlations can result in spurious and harmful predictions.</p>
